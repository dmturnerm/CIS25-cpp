this is a simple clohing inventory system that stores clothes 
in this project I used data types, file types,pointers, arrays, binary search, strings, and two classes.

 A main challenge i had was with error messages i didn;t know what some of them meant, meaning I
 didn't know how to fix them I did research to help me try to figure it out. 
 I honestly was not able to figure it out, it is really disappointing because I wanted to use this as foundation for my final
 but since I have not been able to figure it out I am not sure I will be able too.
